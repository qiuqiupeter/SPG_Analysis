# SPG_Analysis

This Python Code aims replace repetitive manual quantification by efficiently generating subperineurial glial (SPG) cells data including 1) internuclear distance, 2) closest nuclei to edge distances, 3) cell area, and 4) cell shape circularity etc. Most importantly, it includes Voronoi Polygon Analysis to efficiently and effectively quantify nuclear spacing in this irregularly-shaped yet multinucleated cell type.

To run this code, you will need to download:
  1. Sample SPG CZI images
  2. Sample_Data_Sheet.csv
